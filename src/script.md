## Presentation Part 1: Introduction
This section introduces the app and demonstrates its basic text overlay capabilities.

🗣️ Your Script: "Hello everyone. Today I'm showcasing gaki, an intelligent video canvas designed to make presentations and videos more dynamic. Instead of pre-rendering all my graphics, I'll create them live."

🤖 AI Prompt:

Create a large, elegant title at the top of the screen that says 'gaki: The Intelligent Video Canvas'.

Expected Outcome: A title overlay appears at the top.

## Presentation Part 2: Defining the Purpose
Here, you'll explain what the app is for while demonstrating the creation of a second, related overlay.

🗣️ Your Script: "At its core, gaki is a platform for real-time visual storytelling. It allows you to generate graphics on the fly, simply by describing what you want."

🤖 AI Prompt:

Underneath the title, create a smaller subtitle that says 'Real-time Visual Storytelling'.

Expected Outcome: A second text overlay appears below the main title.

## Presentation Part 3: What It's NOT
This step is crucial for differentiation and showcases the powerful update capability of the AI.

🗣️ Your Script: "It’s important to clarify that this is a professional creation tool, not another social media platform. In fact, I can have the AI update the subtitle to make that point clear."

🤖 AI Prompt:

Update the subtitle to say 'A Creation Tool, NOT a Social Media Platform'. Make the text red.

AI Popover Settings: In the "Target Overlay" dropdown, select the subtitle component (it will likely be named subtitle or similar).

Expected Outcome: The subtitle text changes and turns red, demonstrating that the AI can modify existing elements.

## Presentation Part 4: Market Analysis (Sequential Chart Building)
This is the core of the demonstration, showing how you can build a data visualization piece by piece.

Step 4.1: Create the Chart

🗣️ Your Script: "Now, let's demonstrate a more complex feature. We can analyze the video creation market. First, I'll ask the AI to create an empty bar chart."

🤖 AI Prompt:

Create a bar chart on the left side of the screen titled 'Video Creation Market Share (2025)'.

Expected Outcome: An empty bar chart with a title appears on the left.

Step 4.2: Add First Data Point

🗣️ Your Script: "The market is dominated by professional suites, which hold roughly 45% of the market."

🤖 AI Prompt:

Add a data point to the 'Market Share' chart. The label is 'Pro Suites' and the value is 45.

AI Popover Settings: Target the chart component (e.g., market_share_chart).

Expected Outcome: The chart updates to show a single bar for "Pro Suites".

Step 4.3: Add Second Data Point

🗣️ Your Script: "Next are the template-based online editors. They're very popular for their simplicity, holding about 35% of the market."

🤖 AI Prompt:

Add a data point for 'Template Editors' with a value of 35 to the chart.

AI Popover Settings: Target the chart component.

Expected Outcome: A second bar appears on the chart.

Step 4.4: Add Final Data Point

🗣️ Your Script: "Finally, there's the emerging segment of AI-assisted tools where gaki operates. This segment is currently smaller at about 12%, but it's the fastest-growing."

🤖 AI Prompt:

Add a final data point to the chart: Label 'AI-Assisted Tools', Value 12.

AI Popover Settings: Target the chart component.

Expected Outcome: The chart is now complete with all three data points.

## Presentation Part 5: Conclusion
This final step showcases the AI's ability to handle multi-step commands and clean up the canvas.

🗣️ Your Script: "The true power of this tool is its fluidity. You can build up a complex visual narrative and then tear it down just as easily to transition to your next point. For instance, I can now clear the screen with a single command."

🤖 AI Prompt:

Delete the title, the subtitle, and the market share chart.

Expected Outcome: All three overlays are removed from the screen simultaneously, providing a clean end to your demonstration.
